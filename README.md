# LeetCode Code Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various code challenges from LeetCode. As part of my coding journey, I have taken up the #100DaysOfCode challenge and will be regularly solving and sharing my solutions here.

## What is LeetCode?

LeetCode is a platform that provides a collection of coding challenges from different domains such as algorithms, data structures, and more. It offers a great opportunity to practice problem-solving skills and improve coding techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on different challenge categories. Each folder contains the solution code files with clear filenames corresponding to the challenge names. Additionally, I have provided brief explanations or comments within the code to clarify the approach and any important details.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the code solutions in this repository. You can navigate through the folders to find challenges of interest or search for specific problems. The code is written in Typescript, and I strive to maintain clean and readable solutions.

You can use these solutions as a reference or a starting point for your own implementations. However, I encourage you to solve the challenges on your own first, as the learning experience and problem-solving skills gained through self-solving are invaluable.

## Contribution

If you have alternative or optimized solutions for any of the challenges, I would be happy to review and consider incorporating them. Please follow the standard GitHub workflow for contributions by forking the repository, making your changes, and creating a pull request.
